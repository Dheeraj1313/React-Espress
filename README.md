# React-Espress
ToDo app in react+typeseript+node

It's just a todo app where user can add and delete data dynamically and save to data base. As a time constraints I just gave a example of one 'get' and a 'post' request.
Tesh stuck :
React, TypeScript.Nose, Express, JavaScript, CSS, HTML


Step to run -
Go into client folder to run front end

npm run

Go into api folder to run back end
npm install
npm run
